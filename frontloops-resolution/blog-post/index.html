          The desire to be respected by someone of the opposite sex is something that runs deep within everyone, even though most people
          don't take the time to find someone who truly respects them. It seems like people are just looking for someone
          to show them the slightest amount of attention, settling for something much less than respect. I am convinced one
          of the best ways to help any relationship grow is showing respect.

          I have come to the conclusion that everyone longs to be respected.Wha is respect? Respect is showing someone extra special
          attention, or hig regard, based on a desire to show them how highly they are valued.
